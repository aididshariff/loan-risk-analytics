# Loan Risk Analytics Project

This is a personal project where I used SQL to analyze loan data and uncover patterns in loan defaults. I built an interactive dashboard in Tableau to present insights that could help lenders assess borrower risk more effectively.

---

## Project Objective

To explore loan default trends and build an insights-driven dashboard that helps stakeholders understand key drivers of loan risk.

---

## Tools & Skills

- **SQL (PostgreSQL & BigQuery)** – data cleaning, transformation, and risk segmentation
- **Tableau** – data storytelling through an interactive dashboard
- **Data Analysis** – translating data into actionable business insights

---

## Key Questions Explored

- Which borrower attributes are most associated with defaults?
- How do default rates vary across income and loan purposes?
- What trends can we observe over time regarding loan issuance and repayment?

---

## Process Overview

1. **Data Cleaning in SQL**
   - Removed or handled missing values
   - Cleaned inconsistent date fields
   - Renamed columns for clarity

2. **SQL Analysis**
   - Estimated the distribution of loan status
   - Calculated the average interest rate by purpose
   - Calculated average risk score by loan status
   - Calculated default rate by term
   - Aggregated the income brackets against loan default
   - Monthly default trends

3. **Tableau Dashboard**
   - Visualized charged-off loan trends
   - Built filters for loan term, purpose, and risk score
   - Designed user-friendly, dynamic insights
